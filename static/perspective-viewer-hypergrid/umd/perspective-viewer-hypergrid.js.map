Then passed to the specified cell renderers' {@link CellRenderer#paint paint} function for rendering.\n *\n * #### Standard Properties\n *\n * On each render of every visible cell, this a fresh instance of an object created from (whose prototype is) a properties object as defined by layer-props.js. It therefore has all the standard properties defined in {@link module:defaults}.\n *\n * #### Additional Properties\n *\n * In addition, the config object has the following additional properties.\n *\n * Properties marked **_read-only_** may in fact be writable, but should be considered **off limits** to overriding. Do not attempt to change these properties inside a {@link DataModel#getCell getCell} method override.\n *\n * Properties marked **_write-only_** are to be defined the cell renderer for use by the caller (the grid renderer).\n *\n * @property {boolean} config.allRowsSelected\n *\n * @property {BoundingRect} config.bounds - Bounding rect of the cell or subcell to be rendered.\n *\n * @property {object} [config.clickRect] - **_Write-only._** The Cell renderer may return in this property a subrect in the cell's local coordinates that represents a click region. If defined by the cell renderer, the CellClick feature will ignore clicks outside the click region. If not defined by the cell renderer, the entire cell is clickable.\n *\n * @property {dataCellCoords} config.dataCell - **_Read-only._** Data coordinates of the cell.\n *\n * @property {dataRowObject} config.dataRow - Access to other column values in the same row.\n *\n * @property {function} config.formatValue - _For cell renderer use only. Not available in `getCell` override._ The cell's value formatter function (based on the formatter name in `config.format`, as possibly mutated by `getCell`).\n *\n * @property {gridCellCoords} config.gridCell - **_Read-only._** Grid coordinates of the cell.\n *\n * @property {string} config.halign - The cell's horizontal alignment property, as interpreted by it's cell renderer.\n *\n * @property {boolean} config.isCellHovered -\n *\n * @property {boolean} config.isCellSelected -\n *\n * @property {boolean} config.isColumnHovered -\n *\n * @property {boolean} config.isColumnSelected -\n *\n * @property {boolean} config.isDataColumn -\n *\n * @property {boolean} config.isDataRow -\n *\n * @property {boolean} config.isFilterRow -\n *\n * @property {boolean} config.isHandleColumn -\n *\n * @property {boolean} config.isHeaderRow -\n *\n * @property {boolean} config.isInCurrentSelectionRectangle -\n *\n * @property {boolean} config.isRowHovered -\n *\n * @property {boolean} config.isRowSelected -\n *\n * @property {boolean} config.isSelected -\n *\n * @property {boolean} config.isTreeColumn -\n *\n * @property {boolean} config.isUserDataArea -\n *\n * @property {number} config.minWidth - **_Write-only._** The Cell renderer should return the pixel width of the rendered contents in this property.\n *\n * @property {boolean} config.mouseDown - The last mousedown event occurred over this cell and the mouse is still down. Note, however, that the mouse may no longer be hovering over this cell when it has been dragged away.\n *\n * @property {} [config.prefillColor] - **_Write-only._** This is the color _already painted_ by the grid renderer behind the cell to be rendered. If the cell's specified background color is the same, renderer may (and should!) skip painting it. If `undefined`, this signals a \"partial render\"; cell renderers that support partial rendering can use `config.snapshot` to determine whether or not to rerender the cell.\n *\n * @property {object} [config.snapshot] - **_Write-only._** Supports _partial render._ In support of the {@link Renderer#paintCellsAsNeeded by-cells} \"partial\" grid renderer, cell renderers can save the essential render parameters in this property so that on subsequent calls, when the parameters are the same, cell renderers can skip the actual rendering. Only when the parameters have changed is the cell rendered and this property reset (with the new parameters). This object would typically include at the very least the (formatted) `value`, plus additional properties as needed to fully describe the appearance of the render, such as color, _etc._ This property is undefined the first time a cell is rendered by the `by-cells` grid renderer. See also the {@link DataModel#configObject}'s `prefillColor` property.\n *\n * @property config.value - Value to be rendered.\n *\n * The renderer has available to it the `.formatValue()` function for formatting the value. The function comes from the localizer named in the `.format` property. If there is no localizer with that name, the function defaults to the `string` localizer's formatter (which simply invokes the value's `toString()` method).\n *\n * Typically a Local primitive value, values can be any type, including objects and arrays. The specified cell renderer is expected to know how to determine the value's type and render it.\n */\n\nvar Base = require('../Base');\n\n/** @constructor\n * @desc Instances of `CellRenderer` are used to render the 2D graphics context within the bound of a cell.\n *\n * Extend this base class to implement your own cell renderer.\n *\n * @tutorial cell-renderer\n */\nvar CellRenderer = Base.extend('CellRenderer', {\n    /**\n     * @desc An empty implementation of a cell renderer, see [the null object pattern](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?NullObject).\n     *\n     * @this {CellEditor}\n     *\n     * @param {CanvasRenderingContext2D} gc\n     *\n     * @param {CellRenderer#renderConfig} config\n     *\n     * @returns {number} Preferred pixel width of content.

In the browser as a global: The logic in the actual parameter expressions + the post-invocation expression\n * will put your API in `window.RangeSelectionModel`.\n * 2.b. In the browser as a module: If you predefine a `window.module` object, the results will be in `module.exports`.\n * The bower component `mnm` makes this easy and also provides a global `require()` function for referencing your module\n * from other closures. In either case, this works with both NodeJs-style export mechanisms -- a single API assignment,\n * `module.exports = yourAPI` *or* a series of individual property assignments, `module.exports.property = property`.\n *\n * Before the IIFE runs, the actual parameter expressions are executed:\n * 1.

If `module` object predefined, use it\n * 2.b. If `module` object undefined, create a `RangeSelectionModel` object\n *\n * After the IIFE returns:\n * Because it always returns undefined, the expression after the || will execute:\n * 1. If `window` object undefined, then we're in NodeJs so we're done\n * 2. If `window` object defined, then we're in browser\n * 2.a. If `module` object predefined, we're done; results are in `moudule.exports`\n * 2.b.

After instantiation, it is the caller's responsibility to insert the scrollbar, {@link FinBar#bar|this.bar}, into the DOM.\n * 3. After insertion, the caller must call {@link FinBar#resize|resize()} at least once to size and position the scrollbar and its thumb. After that, `resize()` should also be called repeatedly on resize events (as the content element is being resized).\n *\n * Suggested configurations:\n * * _**Unbound**_<br/>\n * The scrollbar serves merely as a simple range (slider) control. Omit both `options.onchange` and `options.content`.\n * * _**Bound to virtual content element**_<br/>\n * Virtual content is projected into the element using a custom event handler supplied by the programmer in `options.onchange`. A typical use case would be to handle scrolling of the virtual content. Other use cases include data transformations, graphics transformations, _etc._\n * * _**Bound to real content**_<br/>\n * Set `options.content` to the \"real\" content element but omit `options.onchange`.

Although the MDN docs say setting this to `{alpha: false}` (opaque canvas) can \"can speed up drawing of transparent content and images,\" our testing (with Chrome v63) failed to show any measurable performance gain.\n *\n * _An opaque canvas does have an important advantage, however!_ It permits the graphics context to use [sub-pixel rendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpixel_rendering) for sharper text as viewed on LCD or LED screens, especially black text on white backgrounds, and especially when viewed on a high-pixel-density display such as an [Apple retina display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina_Display).\n *\n * Zoom in on the following samples images to see the difference in rendering.\n *\n * Value | Sample\n * :---: | :----:\n * `{ alpha: true }`<br>Transparent canvas,<br>renders text using<br>_regular anti-aliasing_ | ![regular.png](https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_645730/ZqurK3)\n * `{ alpha: false }`<br>Opaque canvas,<br>renders text using<br>_sub-pixel rendering_ | ![sub-pixel.png](https://cdn-std.dprcdn.net/files/acc_645730/bf3VXh).\n *\n * Use with caution, however. In particular, if the canvas is set to \"opaque\" (`{alpha: false}`), do _not_ also specify a transparent or translucent color for `grid.properties.backGround` because content may then be drawn with corrupt anti-aliasing (at lest as of Chrome v67).\n *\n * To clarify, the default setting (`{ alpha: true }`) is a transparent canvas, meaning that elements rendered underneath the `<canvas>` element can be seen through any non-opaque pixels (pixels with alpha channel < 1.0). Hypergrids that set their background color to non-opaque can see this effect.\n *\n * Note: An opaque canvas can still be made _to appear_ translucent using the CSS `opacity` property. But that is a different effect entirely, setting the entire rendered canvas to translucent, not just so all pixels become translucent.\n * @param {string} [options.localization=Hypergrid.localization]\n * @param {string|string[]} [options.localization.locale=Hypergrid.localization.locale] - The default locale to use when an explicit `locale` is omitted from localizer constructor calls.

When the grid shape changes, we reset their coordinates by setting {@link CellEvent#reset|reset} on each.\n *\n * **Regading clipping.** The reason for clipping is to prevent text from overflowing into the next column. However there is a serious performance cost.\n *\n * For performance reasons {@link Renderer#_paintCell|_paintCell} does not set up a clipping region for each cell. However, iff grid property `columnClip` is truthy, this grid renderer will set up a clipping region to prevent text overflow to right. If `columnClip` is `null`, a clipping region will only be set up on the last column. Otherwise, there will be no clipping region.\n *\n * The idea of clipping just the last column is because in addition to the optional graphics clipping, we also clip (\"truncate\") text. Text can be truncated conservatively so it will never overflow. The problem with this is that characters vanish as they hit the right cell boundary, which may or may be obvious depending on font size. Alternatively, text can be truncated so that the overflow will be a maximum of 1 character. This allows partial characters to be rendered. But this is where graphics clipping is required.\n *\n * When renderering column by column as this particular renderer does, _and_ when the background color _of the next cell to the right_ is opaque (alpha = 1), clipping can be turned off because each column will _overpaint_ any text that overflowed from the one before. However, any text that overflows the last column will paint into unused canvas region to the right of the grid. This is the _raison d'être_ for \"clip last column only\" option mentioned above (when `columnClip` is set to `null`). To avoid even this performance cost (of clipping just the last column), column widths can be set to fill the available canvas.\n *\n * Note that text never overflows to left because text starting point is never < 0. The reason we don't clip to the left is for cell renderers that need to re-render to the left to produce a merged cell effect, such as grouped column header.\n\n * @this {Renderer}\n * @param {CanvasRenderingContext2D} gc\n * @memberOf Renderer.prototype\n */\nfunction paintCellsByColumns(gc) {\n    var grid = this.grid,\n        gridProps = grid.properties,\n        prefillColor, gridPrefillColor = gridProps.backgroundColor,\n        cellEvent,\n        columnBundle, columnBundles,\n        visibleColumns = this.visibleColumns,\n        visibleRows = this.visibleRows,\n        c, C = visibleColumns.length, cLast = C - 1,\n        r, R = visibleRows.length,\n        pool = this.cellEventPool,\n        preferredWidth,\n        columnClip,\n        // clipToGrid,\n        viewWidth = C ? visibleColumns[cLast].right : 0,\n        viewHeight = R ? visibleRows[R - 1].bottom : 0;\n\n\n    gc.clearRect(0, 0, this.bounds.width, this.bounds.height);\n\n    if (!C || !R) { return; }\n\n    if (gc.alpha(gridPrefillColor) > 0) {\n        gc.cache.fillStyle = gridPrefillColor;\n        gc.fillRect(0, 0, viewWidth, viewHeight);\n    }\n\n    if (this.gridRenderer.reset) {\n        this.resetAllGridRenderers(['by-columns-discrete']);\n        this.gridRenderer.reset = false;\n        bundleColumns.call(this, true);\n    } else if (this.gridRenderer.rebundle) {\n        this.gridRenderer.rebundle = false;\n        bundleColumns.call(this);\n    }\n\n    for (columnBundles = this.columnBundles, c = columnBundles.length; c--;) {\n        columnBundle = columnBundles[c];\n        gc.clearFill(columnBundle.left, 0, columnBundle.right - columnBundle.left, viewHeight, columnBundle.backgroundColor);\n    }\n\n    // gc.clipSave(clipToGrid, 0, 0, viewWidth, viewHeight);\n\n    // For each column...\n    var p = 0;\n    this.visibleColumns.forEachWithNeg(function(vc, c) {\n        cellEvent = pool[p]; // first cell in column c\n        vc = cellEvent.visibleColumn;\n\n        prefillColor = cellEvent.column.properties.backgroundColor;\n\n        // Optionally clip to visible portion of column to prevent text from overflowing to right.\n        columnClip = vc.column.properties.columnClip;\n        gc.clipSave(columnClip || columnClip === null && c === cLast, 0, 0, vc.right, viewHeight);\n\n        // For each row of each subgrid (of each column)...\n        for (preferredWidth = r = 0; r < R; r++, p++) {\n            cellEvent = pool[p]; // next cell down the column (redundant for first cell in column)\n\n            try {\n                preferredWidth = Math.max(preferredWidth, this._paintCell(gc, cellEvent, prefillColor));\n            } catch (e) {\n                this.renderErrorCell(e, gc, vc, cellEvent.visibleRow);\n            }\n        }\n\n        gc.clipRestore(columnClip);\n\n        cellEvent.column.properties.preferredWidth = Math.round(preferredWidth);\n    }, this);\n\n    // gc.clipRestore(clipToGrid);\n\n    this.paintGridlines(gc);\n}\n\npaintCellsByColumns.key = 'by-columns';\npaintCellsByColumns.rebundle = true; // see rebundleGridRenderers\n\nmodule.exports = paintCellsByColumns;\n","'use strict';\n\nvar bundleColumns = require('./bundle-columns');\n\n/** @summary Render the grid with discrete column rects.\n * @desc Paints all the cells of a grid, one column at a time.\n *\n * In this grid renderer, a background rect is _not_ drawn using the grid background color.\n *\n * Rather, all columns paint their own background rects, with color defaulting to grid background color.\n *\n * The idea of painting each column rect is to \"clip\" text that might have overflowed from the previous column by painting over it with the background from this column.

If your handler does choose to re-emit the event itself by calling `dispatchGridEvent`, you should propagate its return value (the result of its internal call to [`dispatchEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/dispatchEvent), which is either `false` if the event was canceled or `true` if it was not).\n *\n */\nmodule.exports = {\n    /**\n     * _See the data model API page for event semantics (link below)._\n     * @param {NormalizedDataModelEvent} event\n     * @returns {undefined|boolean} Result of re-emitted event or `undefined` if event not re-emitted.\n     * @see {@link DataModel#event:fin-hypergrid-schema-loaded}\n     * @memberOf dataModelEventHandlers\n     */\n    'fin-hypergrid-schema-loaded': function(event) {\n        this.behavior.createColumns();\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * _See the data model API page for event semantics (link below)._\n     * @param {NormalizedDataModelEvent} event\n     * @returns {undefined|boolean} Result of re-emitted event or `undefined` if event not re-emitted.\n     * @see {@link DataModel#event:fin-hypergrid-data-loaded}\n     * @memberOf dataModelEventHandlers\n     */\n    'fin-hypergrid-data-loaded': function(event) {\n        this.repaint();\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * _See the data model API page for event semantics (link below)._\n     * @param {NormalizedDataModelEvent} event\n     * @returns {undefined|boolean} Result of re-emitted event or `undefined` if event not re-emitted.\n     * @see {@link DataModel#event:fin-hypergrid-data-shape-changed}\n     * @memberOf dataModelEventHandlers\n     */\n    'fin-hypergrid-data-shape-changed': function(event) {\n        this.behaviorShapeChanged();\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * _See the data model API page for event semantics (link below)._\n     * @param {NormalizedDataModelEvent} event\n     * @returns {undefined|boolean} Result of re-emitted event or `undefined` if event not re-emitted.\n     * @see {@link DataModel#event:fin-hypergrid-data-prereindex}\n     * @memberOf dataModelEventHandlers\n     */\n    'fin-hypergrid-data-prereindex': function(event) {\n        this.stashRowSelections();\n        this.stashColumnSelections();\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * _See the data model API page for event semantics (link below)._\n     * @param {{type}} event\n     * @returns {undefined|boolean} Result of re-emitted event or `undefined` if event not re-emitted.\n     * @see {@link DataModel#event:fin-hypergrid-data-postreindex}\n     * @memberOf dataModelEventHandlers\n     */\n    'fin-hypergrid-data-postreindex': function(event) {\n        this.selectionModel.reset();\n        this.unstashRowSelections();\n        this.unstashColumnSelections();\n        this.behaviorShapeChanged();\n    }\n};\n","'use strict';\n\nvar Registry = require('../lib/Registry');\n\n\nvar warnedBaseClass;\n\n/**\n * @classdesc Registry of cell editor constructors.\n * @constructor\n */\nvar CellEditors = Registry.extend('CellEditors', {\n\n    BaseClass: require('./CellEditor'), // abstract base class\n\n    initialize: function() {\n        // preregister the standard cell editors\n        this.add(require('./Color'));\n        this.add(require('./Date'));\n        this.add(require('./Number'));\n        this.add(require('./Slider'));\n        this.add(require('./Spinner'));\n        this.add(require('./Textfield'));\n    },\n\n    get: function(name) {\n        if (name && name.toLowerCase() === 'celleditor') {\n            if (!warnedBaseClass) {\n                console.warn('grid.cellEditors.get(\"' + name + '\") method call has been deprecated as of v2.1.0 in favor of grid.cellEditors.BaseClass property.

The original implementation (<= `1.1.2`) only considered the column headers proper (_i.e.,_ the bottom row, _e.g.,_ the \"leaf nodes\" in a pivot) in calculating the column width, which had the potential to truncate lengthy group labels that exceeded the sum of the column widths.\n *\n * As of `1.2.0,` if the new plugin property `this.autosizeGroups` is truthy _and_ `config.headerTextWrapping` is falsy, columns will be autosized to prevent truncation of group labels. The algorithm to accomplish this is complicated. First we build a lists of max widths for each level of grouping and for the columns as well.\n *\n * We do and re-do the above on each successive column, just as we do and re-do the group label renderering, because we cannot tell what's coming up and therefore cannot tell for certain when a column group ends.
